* Sysctl - Policy related to sysctl

## How to configure this policy

I am too lazy to explain it right now. Please look at examples/promises.cf for
an example implementation.

** How to integrate into your policy
First get the policy into your masterfiles

#+begin_src sh
  cd /tmp
  export MASTERFILES=/var/cfengine/masterfiles
  git clone https://github.com/nickanderson/cfengine-sysctl.git
  cd cfengine-sysctl
  mkdir -p $MASTERFILES/services/sysctl
  git archive master | tar -x -C $MASTERFILES/services/sysctl
#+end_src

Include def.cf into your inputs

#+begin_src cfengine
  body common control
  {
        inputs => {
                    # Reports
                    @(cfengine_reports.inputs),

                   "services/sysctl/def.cf",

                    # autorun system
                    @(services_autorun.inputs),
        };
  }
#+end_src

Activate the features you want in the proper context.

For example to inventory the settings in /etc/sysctl.conf on all linux
nodes:

#+begin_src cfengine3
  bundle agent main
  # User Defined Service Catalogue
  {
    methods:
      # Activate your custom policies here
      linux::
        "Inventory /etc/sysctl.conf settings"
          usebundle => sysctl_conf_inventory;
  }
#+end_src
